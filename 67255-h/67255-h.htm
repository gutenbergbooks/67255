<small>EDWY&#8217;S WISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Father</span>, may I have an English setter
for my Christmas present?&#8221;</p>

<p>Edwy spoke in a subdued tone, for the
president of a certain Association, a country
club, of which his father was a member,
had come to say good-bye. One branch of
the party of campers on the lake was about
to break up; city schools were calling them
from forest and from field.</p>

<p>The stranger had taken a seat on the broad
veranda, his dog at his heels, his carriage
and horses waiting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Bruno knew his little friend Edwy. The
boy stood stroking the dog&#8217;s ears and speaking
gentle words to him. The dog seemed to
listen but although he was all attention and
laid his head down on crossed paws, one eye
was alert for the movements of his master.</p>

<p>A dog, an English setter like Bruno, was
one thing which Edwy had sought with constant
iteration since he was old enough to
talk; especially since he had seen the devotion
of Bruno for his master and even his
master&#8217;s horses. He had also gained the
dog&#8217;s confidence towards himself.</p>

<p>Edwy&#8217;s mother felt that she must not let
him keep on hoping for the impossible. They
could not take a dog to a city home while
they were building the camp on the lake. It
was equally out of the question either, to
carry him back and forth on the cars, or to
leave him at home with servants while all
the family were away.</p>

<p>As he stood stroking the dog&#8217;s ears and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
speaking his own little tender words to him,
the watchful mother explained, aside, the
reason of the refusal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Edwy, a dog gets so terribly
homesick if left in the care of servants.
Just see how Bruno is waiting to leap to his
master&#8217;s side, and fly down the road the moment
the horse&#8217;s hoofs ring on the highway....
When you are older....&#8221;</p>

<p>How Edwy hated the words, &#8220;when you
are older!&#8221; It always meant that you couldn&#8217;t
have something when you wanted it. But
as he was a well-bred child, he always kept
quiet in company. He had sometimes confided
to Willard, his brother, but that didn&#8217;t
help much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I have a kitten then? I do want
some kind of a thing that isn&#8217;t either dumb
or dead.&#8221; A certain chum of Edwy&#8217;s&mdash;not
the usual kind of a chum&mdash;but one in his
own and Willard&#8217;s estimation well worthy of
the name, had noticed the fact that the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
had so bravely banished the frown of disappointment.
She had also noted the fact that
no ban had been placed against a kitten, and
a plan was forming in her mind, but she did
not divulge it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE LITTLE TRAPPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwy</span> had been called &#8220;The Little Trapper.&#8221;
He had read every book he could find
about animals. After reading some of them,
he would be the &#8220;warrior bold&#8221;; would long
to be old enough to shoot and slay and pursue
big game through the forest spaces, but
bless his heart, he hadn&#8217;t the least idea that
there was any tragedy in it. He had made
box-traps with his own hands, but in such a
way, however, that it would hardly frighten
the little creatures to be caught, for he would
only keep the little prisoners an hour, or a
minute perhaps, feed them, and let them go
free.</p>

<p>One day he had found in his trap a pretty
brown-eyed musk-rat, and the creature found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
himself liberated beside his own stream, not
a bit the worse for its experience. And one
day he found a strange slate-colored dormouse,
but it had managed to get out of its
cage by its own ingenuity or some one&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>Another day he caught several little
squirrels, first getting one, then another, and
another, and letting them pass by a bridge of
his own or his father&#8217;s contriving, from one
box to another, but they were all to be set
free in a short time and seemed to think it
was mere play. At first they seemed to try
to tease each other, their comrades, for the
moment. He had discovered that in this first
stage they would not eat, but after a while
he had rushed into the house to tell Willard
his new discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Willard, they&#8217;ve all got acquainted
with each other, and they know me. They
seem to know that I don&#8217;t mean to hurt them,
and now they &#8216;grab&#8217; for everything I offer
them to eat.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>It soon became evident that the squirrel families
would have to be more severely
dealt with, for more than once they had disturbed
the little birds on their nests, and in
some cases had been known to destroy their
eggs; so a plan was formed to transport one
or two of the squirrel families to another
portion of the woods, and thus leave the robins
and the warblers in undisputed possession
near the camp.</p>

<p>At length came the plans for the opening
of the doors of the temporary trap, to introduce
the squirrels to their new forest home.</p>

<p>Where the lake laps the shore, several
rowboats were drawn up in line and it was
but the work of a moment to embark, for all
the interested members of the little group
could enter readily into the child&#8217;s feelings.
The morning was one of the gems of June,
with crystal sky and lake. As the boats sped
out towards the further shore the wise little
creatures in the box crowded further back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
massed themselves in a bunch, their feet towards
the opening of the box, their pointed
noses quivering with excitement. Their little
sharp bead-like eyes alert, but less full of
fear than at first, for already they had
grown familiar with a petting word from the
little &#8220;trapper&#8221; and friend, and were fast
growing trustful of their human kind.</p>

<p>Now the problem was to get them to cross
the small channel of deep water which lay
between them and the shore. A rustic bridge
was made by means of a wide board, and then
the doors were opened! Such a patter of
little twinkling feet as they ran, one after
another, &#8220;low geared&#8221; for the land, while
the party sailed back or remained on the lake
to enjoy the delights of rod and line, the
feast of the flowers on the banks and the
songs of numberless birds, all part of the
glorious summer time.</p>

<small>A WELCOME GUEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> weeks previous to this, while the
campers still thought they had the whole
summer before them, a little white kitten
with gold spots, had come, seemingly from
nowhere, and had sought admission&mdash;not to
Edwy&#8217;s camp&mdash;but to his Uncle&#8217;s, across the
lake.</p>

<p>His Uncle&#8217;s wife was the dearest, the most
teasable aunt in the world. She was known
sometimes as &#8220;Aida,&#8221; from a pet name one
of them had given her. They had never
called her Aunt, but always some nice pet
name and always pretended they didn&#8217;t care
a flip for her, but she knew better, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
wasn&#8217;t she their own mother&#8217;s sister, who
had also a pet name of her own? And were
they not both daughters of this great chum
of theirs, who, as their father had told them
was entirely their own contemporary and
equal, but at the same time they mustn&#8217;t
tease her or treat her as if they were playing
football; and mustn&#8217;t touch her pretty white
dress with their &#8220;candy&#8221; fingers.</p>

<p>Edwy was glad that the kitten had come
to visit them. He was afraid that the winter
would be hard on the poor thing....
Everybody said it could take care of itself,
but why couldn&#8217;t it take care of itself now?
It came every morning, to ask them for food
and would give its high-toned purr of satisfaction
when they had fed it.</p>

<p>Much as Edwy liked it, he was glad that
it had not come to his father&#8217;s camp, for
they had some little rabbits.</p>

<p>They had brought them, when old enough,
from their own home, and had let them run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
wild through the woods and underbrush, near
the woods and the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;But would you believe it, Willard?&#8221; he
said to his brother, &#8220;they come back to our
camp, just as soon as they hear my voice
shouting to them, half a mile away, and then
they begin to show up out of the underbrush.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was always jolly at his Aunt&#8217;s camp,
for in his own camp, he feared the rabbits
and the kitten might not agree, and he and
Willard were quite as much at home in the
one place as the other.</p>

<p>The only time when the kitten had visited
their camp on the hill was once, when they
had all been away a few days, and when
both camps were empty for that length of
time.</p>

<p>On coming back, the very first thing they
saw, in front of Edwy&#8217;s father&#8217;s camp, was
the little white kitten sitting on the door-step,
crying a glad welcome to them, arching its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
back, and reaching up for them to pet it.
Very soon Edwy took the megaphone from
its corner and called over the lake....</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound of Aida&#8217;s voice came floating
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes: I can hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all thought our little Zephyr was lost,
but she is here, all safe and sound; and she&#8217;s
had a bowl of milk. Willard and I are going
to row the boat over the lake, and bring her
back to your house, Aida, for that is her real
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>On reaching the other shore, Aida and
Mo-ma were glad to welcome the boys with
their pet, for they had all feared she was
lost. She had found her way to the other
house, along a wood road, they thought, all
the way. If she had gone along the borders
of the lake, it would have been much nearer,
but it was swampy that way, so she must
have taken the high road and had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
friends with the tame rabbits, not hurting
any of them.</p>

<p>The boys were well pleased with the result
of their afternoon&#8217;s visit, for Zephyr seemed
so glad to get home, that she went through
all her little antics for them, hiding under
the wood pile, then leaping out to surprise
them and glancing up in their faces almost
as if she were laughing, trying races with
them along the wooded shore. After the
boys had partaken of the nice little lunch
that Aida had planned for them, some cake
and berries, crimson raspberries that had
grown in the field by the road-side, it was
time to take the boat for their homeward
trip.</p>

<p>Zephyr followed them to the bank and
looked after them as long as there was light
enough to see the boat. Aida also, watching
them off, and their dear mother outlined
against the further shore, waiting their arrival.</p>

<small>ZEPHYR &#8220;SECOND&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Edwy himself who had named the
cat Zephyr second. For one summer they
had a cat visitor that he named Zephyr, but
she had gone back to her home among the
mountains and they had never seen her again.
But for this little kitten that had come to
them, so white, so pretty and engaging, a
real snow-flake in color, so tiny and playful;
Zephyr seemed such an appropriate name.
He could not call it Zephyr alone, for that
would have seemed like forgetting the former
one, who was not so beautiful as this
one, and had never leaped higher than one&#8217;s
head like this one, but Zephyr second, or
Zephyr II, would be quite the thing, and keep
the former one in memory.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>He was glad that this one had come to his
Aunt Aida&#8217;s, for they would be a month
longer in camp, and then Zephyr&#8217;s winter
would not seem so long.</p>

<p>He seemed more and more appreciative of
all the graceful pranks of his pet when she
ran like a wild happy thing, leaping up as
high as the fence posts after butterflies in
the sunshine, running up to the very tops of
the trees, and back again, but never catching
the birds, oh no; she was too happy to lie in
wait for them, and the best trick of all was,
when she would sit on the bank and watch
for a boat coming from the other camp,
every time he and Willard were out of her
sight. She would listen for the lapping of
the oars, then leap to the bank, give a glad
little cry, arch her back, and give her sweet,
high-toned purr when they came near.</p>

<p>One evening before it was quite dark,
when supper was just ready at their father&#8217;s
camp on the hill, Aida and Mo-ma had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
over to stay all night. They were to have
their even-song, with the organ, violin, and
guitar, and the sweet human sympathetic
voices of all in unison. The songs which
Edwy was sure &#8220;could be heard by the birds
in their nests high up in the tall trees, that
leaned over the camp roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had just heard Willard and his father,
fastening their boat at the foot of the
hill, and now they, &#8220;the truants,&#8221; were running
quickly up the stone steps from the landing,
when Willard, the first comer, opened
the door and thrust some object inside.</p>

<p>It was none other than Zephyr!</p>

<p>&#8220;While we were passing your dock, we saw
Zephyr waiting all alone on the bank. We
called to her, and she came running down
and we took her right into the boat with us,
and here she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You precious darling,&#8221; said Edwy, stroking
her.</p>

<p>As supper was now ready, he took her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
his lap, and, contrary to all rules, he fed her,
as the poet Maeterlinck used to do with his
pet cat, talking to her in his happy voice in
his own place at the table.</p>

<p>The evening had grown cool enough to
have a fire of apple-tree wood, blazing before
the broad hearth, so before they began their
even-song, Willard had laid the moss-covered
logs together and lighted them, removing
first the dainty fender, which his own
hands had made, with artistic deftness; having
woven in the name of their camp among
the interstices of the woven wire. Now,
where the welcome fire-glow shone through
it on the hearth-rug. Zephyr had taken her
position, quite at home and happy; purring
her &#8220;grey thrums,&#8221; louder than ever, in her
contentment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE REAL MEANING OF CHRISTMAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed now as if this second camp,
where Zephyr lived, had new attractions for
Edwy. He would spend the days happily
with his friends.</p>

<p>Here was that teasable aunt Aida, and his
friend, &#8220;Mo-ma&#8221;; his own little conceit to
avoid the longer name, but then he had as
many pet names for her, as there were
months in the year. She never held up other
boys to them as examples, for she always
seemed to think that he and Willard were the
&#8220;best ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was drawing near the time that one
branch of the family of campers would have
to say good-bye to summer fields and woods,
and go back to the city and school. Edwy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
felt a little blue about leaving his pets and
had a quiet talk with this special friend of
his, after the rest had gone out on the lake
to have a last chance at the trout fishing,
before leaving the lake.</p>

<p>He was in the reminiscent mood that precedes
sleep, and was telling his friend how
much he wished they would always stay in
the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, after all, you would miss the bright,
happy Christmas, in the city home, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, to be sure, and we&#8217;ll have the
lovely snowflakes coming down from the sky,
and a lot of good times.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had asked him then, when they were
talking about Christmas, and about all the
delights of that time, if he knew the real
meaning of Christmas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why yes,&#8221; he had answered. &#8220;It is to
keep in mind a very great event in the world,
the greatest that ever happened. But then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
you know, it wouldn&#8217;t be Christmas to us
boys, if we didn&#8217;t get some gifts of our very
own, for we can&#8217;t always be thinking &#8216;big
thoughts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So many things,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;were impossible
until he was older. He had wanted
a dog, but he couldn&#8217;t have that. He had
asked for a cat, but, of course, he couldn&#8217;t
have that. He could only have kids&#8217; things.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he was only a shepherd he could have
some lambs. He had once had a tame weasel
and it was the dearest thing, but you couldn&#8217;t
pet a weasel, although you could get to love
it, and feel as if the world had come to an
end when it died.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there was always one Christmas that
he remembered. He had got a lot of things
that day, but when night came he was so
tired, that he had a fight with his brother.
Oh, not a real fight, you know; only the kind
that brothers always have. People may
think you awful, and send you off to bed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
half the time you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter.
Why, that was only last Christmas?
Do you remember that night, Mo-ma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were at home in the city,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;You had come up to my room and
sat by me. I was all covered up with the
quilt, so you wouldn&#8217;t see my red eyes. All
at once we heard some one singing. It was
only Mamma and Aida. Mamma was playing
the air on the dear violin, Aida accompanying
her on the piano and singing, and
she always gives one a chance to hear the
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Edwy, I remember. You flew out of
bed and leaned over the banisters to hear.
It was from The Oratorio of the &#8216;Messiah.&#8217;
You wished they would play and sing it all
night. You had forgotten all your troubles
in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can hear it now, even after all these
months, as the remembrance of it comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
through the still evening air. &#8216;He shall feed
his flock ... feed his flock ... like a shepherd.
He shall carry the lambs in his bosom,
and shall gently lead those that are with
young.&#8217; Then you told me the story about
His life, after I came back to bed, and I
fell asleep, saying it over and over. He shall
feed his flock ... feed his flock ... like
a shepherd ... and carry the lambs in his
bosom ... the little ... little ... lambs!&#8221;</p>

<small>DEPARTURE OF THE FIRST GROUP OF CAMPERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwy&#8217;s</span> special friend had noticed how
bravely he had given up the idea of taking
any of the country pets to the city, at least
until he grew older, but there was one little
plan which she had not as yet divulged to
anybody. She had remarked to herself that
a kitten had not been forbidden, simply because
it had not been thought of as a possibility.
After the boys and their parents had
said good-bye to their camp, and the whistle
of their train could be heard far over the
hills, she began to take a new course with
Zephyr. The little lonesome creature would
go often down to the bank, and seem to
watch for the coming of a boat and a welcoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
warwhoop, but would always come
back disappointed. It was at such times that
Aida and her mother would have a loving
word for Zephyr, and it evidently was at a
loss to know what such unusual attention
meant. For instance, Zephyr might have
wondered why she was so often invited to
go to sleep in a large cushioned box, with
a wire cover, not often closed, over her; and
why she was fed occasional dainties in this
place, until she had grown to love it, and feel
perfectly at home in it.</p>

<p>Up to this time, they had not been quite
sure but that some one might claim Zephyr,
but they had found out by accident, that a
family had moved away from a near-by hamlet,
and had left this helpless creature to the
mercy of fierce dogs and winter terrors; but
a kind Providence that doth not let even the
sparrows fall had brought her to a good
home, and now, that it had been decided
what could be done for her by the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
friends at the camp, there was no lack
of affection shown. So Zephyr grew soft
and fluffy and more engaging than ever, had
no fear of her wire-covered box, in which
she was being prepared for a longer journey,
and eventually for summers and winters
to come. In this way she might be
brought back and forth to the camp every
summer.</p>

<p>Some weeks had passed before the second
army of campers were ready to leave. The
autumn days had turned the leaves of the
forest from gold to crimson, the Hermit
thrush had ceased its song of the even-tide,
and when they were all ready to leave the
camp, Zephyr did not seem at all surprised
to be taken along with them. She was taken
to Aida&#8217;s home at first, for her (Aida&#8217;s) tall
husband had at last come home, braving the
dangers of the war-ravaged seas.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>ONE OF ZEPHYR&#8217;S SUMMER HOMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Aida&#8217;s real summer home was in a
lovely small city in one of the more northern
belts of the state, she would not go to
the great city for a month yet. So this
country house, the Blake home, happened
to be Zephyr&#8217;s first stopping place. While
mother and daughter, in the quiet of the
home garden, had many a talk under the trees
about the friends who had preceded them to
that great city, which has always welcomed
its own people; and also the oppressed of all
nations, and honored them so long as the
privileges of citizenship were appreciated.
To those who seemed to understand intuitively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
that the &#8220;Statue of Liberty,&#8221; presented
by a sister nation, meant more of friendship,
loyalty, and respect, than words could express,
it was a most wonderful boon, and at
once the &#8220;Empire city&#8221; seemed to become
law-abiding, by absorption, under the leadership
of the great souls who ruled both city
and country, and their appreciation of this
new and lasting bond.</p>

<p>While Aida and her mother were happy
in the garden and thinking &#8220;Big thoughts,&#8221;
Edwy&#8217;s pretty name for all he could not
quite comprehend, Aida, looking up, saw a
shadow pass over her mother&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Edwy were here, dearest, he would
ask his friend, <i>why</i>? And he would wait
for you to answer his loving question, but
I think I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do any of us know, when our boys
come to be grown men, what may they not
have to do to hold such liberty sacred? Can
we be sure that their beautiful lives might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
not have to pay the toll of enrollment for
their sacred trust&mdash;for their country?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a thought she would not leave in
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;If both boys were here, dear, they would
remind you of the Shepherd&#8217;s story, which
you have so often told them.&#8221;</p>

<p>By way of taking her mind from life&#8217;s
strange vicissitudes, Aida called her attention
to the fact of Zephyr&#8217;s disappearance.
Where could it have gone?</p>

<p>The little creature never seemed to have
felt quite so much at home as at the North.
It had missed the lake, the boats and the
merry voices of the two boys, as they came
between the two camps, with the sound of
beating oars. Sure enough, Zephyr had gone
without even touching her breakfast.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a little girl came along
the garden walk, stepping over the bank beside
Aida&#8217;s lovely flowers, many of them still
blooming although so late in the autumn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought your Kitty home,&#8221; she said
gently. &#8220;But she loves to stay right in my
arms. I found her in the schoolroom, and I
don&#8217;t believe she would have been afraid of
any of the boys for they all petted her, but
the teacher was having them say some dates
in unison, and it made such a racket that she
came running to me, and I knew just who
owned her, for I had seen her in your garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, thank you a thousand times! Zephyr
shall know you as her little friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I take her to school again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day if you wish, and play with her
here, too, under the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were the dates that the scholars
were saying in unison?&#8221; the mother asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;One was the date on which the beautiful
Statue of Liberty came from France with
its motto, &#8216;Liberty Enlightening the World.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what we were talking about, dear,&#8221;
said the mother thoughtfully. &#8220;Ever since its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
arrival, it has been wreathed with loving, and
often poetic thought, and I am glad that
our schools are asking you to remember the
dates of great events.</p>

<p>&#8220;While we are staying here she can go to
school with you every day, and you are welcome
here, too, among Aida&#8217;s flowers!&#8221;</p>

<small>A SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> had really come at last, the snowflakes
had covered the brown fields, and time
was fast hastening on to bring the great day
of all the year, Christmas day. Aida had
sent gifts that she knew they would like,
their Uncle had brought them some gifts
from Paris, and this special friend of theirs
had her own plan, that made her smile to
herself, when she thought how Edwy loved
things that he could pet and fondle and call
his own. The other presents had all been
sent early to their city home, and messages
of thanks had been sent back, but the question
had been flashed back to the senders:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you come yourselves? Christmas
day is never Christmas day, unless you
are here!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was almost over, and, as yet, not
any sign of the rest of the group as the slow
hours passed.</p>

<p>All at once there was a loud sound of
tramping in the hall, then a shout of welcome
in the air, and Edwy hoped it might be one
person ... no, two, whom he loved, and
who loved him. And sure enough, he was not
disappointed. Aida was there, and right behind
her Edwy&#8217;s friend appeared on the
scene, all trim and fine, her eyes full of
love; and before they knew it, she had made
a pounce upon Edwy, and the next moment
had him in her arms.</p>

<p>She said nothing about a wire-covered box
that stood in the hall, but seeing it accidentally
after he had given her a good hug,
&#8220;a real bear-hug,&#8221; he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ve brought down one of my box-traps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Is it one of them? But we don&#8217;t need
any box-traps here, for there&#8217;s nothing to
catch.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Willard, by this time, had torn off
the cover.... The box was opened wide at
last, and oh! wonder of wonders! here was
the little white cat, their beautiful Zephyr,
looking up at them with questioning eyes.</p>

<p>The shout that went up ended suddenly
with the peculiarly happy screech of an Indian
warwhoop, a sound they had not heard
from Edwy&#8217;s lips for many a month. Instead
of jumping out of her box at once,
Zephyr sat up on her cushion, and began to
wash her face with her velvet paw, and when
she saw Edwy, she began at once that high-toned
purr, as if to show her gratitude, that
after her long journey, she had found her
friends. Her next act was to jump out of
her box, after one look at their glad faces,
and another glance from floor to ceiling and
from ceiling to floor, she started on a wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
chase after one of the Christmas apples, that
had rolled out on the floor.</p>

<p>The boy and the cat now had their race
of pure delight from room to room. While
the grace of her motions seemed the most
wonderful in the world, making all the people laugh,
the rapt happy look on Edwy&#8217;s
face was a greater joy. It was a marvel of
expression.</p>

<p>Zephyr was his very own, to keep always!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
